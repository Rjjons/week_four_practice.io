        <h4>Describe the components of the CSS Box Model.</h4>
        <p>
          The CSS Box Model is a fundamental concept in web design and layout
          that describes the structure of every HTML element as a rectangular
          box. It consists of several components that define the dimensions,
          spacing, and layout of an element. The main components of the CSS Box
          Model are as follows:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Content: The innermost part of the box, where the actual content of
          the element is displayed. It includes text, images, or any other
          content defined within the element.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Padding: The transparent area around the content, inside the border
          of the element. Padding adds space between the content and the border.
          It can be set using the padding property and can have different values
          for each side of the element (e.g., padding-top, padding-right,
          padding-bottom, padding-left).
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Border: The border surrounds the padding and content of the
          element. It can have a specific width, style, and color, defined using
          the border property. Like padding, border properties can also be set
          individually for each side (e.g., border-top, border-right,
          border-bottom, border-left).
        </p>

        <p>
          4. Margin: The transparent area outside the border of the element,
          separating it from other elements in the layout. Margins provide space
          between elements and prevent them from touching each other. Like
          padding and border, margins can be set using the margin property and
          can have different values for each side of the element (e.g.,
          margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom, margin-left).
        </p>

        <h4>
          What is the purpose of the content, padding, border, and margin in the
          CSS Box Model?
        </h4>
        <p>
          The CSS Box Model is a fundamental concept in web design that
          describes the structure of every HTML element as a rectangular box.
          Each box consists of four main components: content, padding, border,
          and margin
