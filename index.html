            <h4>Describe the components of the CSS Box Model.</h4>
            <p>
                The CSS Box Model is a fundamental concept in web design and layout
                that describes the structure of every HTML element as a rectangular
                box. It consists of several components that define the dimensions,
                spacing, and layout of an element. The main components of the CSS Box
                Model are as follows:
            </p>
            <p>
                1. Content: The innermost part of the box, where the actual content of
                the element is displayed. It includes text, images, or any other
                content defined within the element.
            </p>
            <p>
                2. Padding: The transparent area around the content, inside the border
                of the element. Padding adds space between the content and the border.
                It can be set using the padding property and can have different values
                for each side of the element (e.g., padding-top, padding-right,
                padding-bottom, padding-left).
            </p>
            <p>
                3. Border: The border surrounds the padding and content of the
                element. It can have a specific width, style, and color, defined using
                the border property. Like padding, border properties can also be set
                individually for each side (e.g., border-top, border-right,
                border-bottom, border-left).
            </p>

            <p>
                4. Margin: The transparent area outside the border of the element,
                separating it from other elements in the layout. Margins provide space
                between elements and prevent them from touching each other. Like
                padding and border, margins can be set using the margin property and
                can have different values for each side of the element (e.g.,
                margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom, margin-left).
            </p>

            <h4>
                What is the purpose of the content, padding, border, and margin in the
                CSS Box Model?
            </h4>
            <p>
                The CSS Box Model is a fundamental concept in web design that
                describes the structure of every HTML element as a rectangular box.
                Each box consists of four main components: content, padding, border,
                and margin
            </p>

                <h4>How can you set different border styles using CSS?</h4>
                <p>
                    Margin, padding, and border are three fundamental components of the
                    CSS Box Model, each serving a distinct purpose in styling and layout
                    of HTML elements. Here are the key differences between them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    1. Margin are the transparent space outside the border of an
                    element. Margins create space between the element and its
                    neighboring elements. Margins do not have a background color or
                    content; they are purely for spacing purposes. Margins can be set
                    using the margin property in CSS, and values can be specified for
                    each side of the element independently (margin-top, margin-right,
                    margin-bottom, margin-left).
                </p>
                <p>
                    2. Padding is the transparent space between the content of an
                    element and its border. Padding creates space within the element
                    itself, between the content and the border. Padding affects the size
                    and layout of the content area. Padding can be set using the padding
                    property in CSS, and values can be specified for each side of the
                    element independently (padding-top, padding-right, padding-bottom,
                    padding-left).
                </p>
                <p>
                    3. Borders are the visible or invisible lines that surround the
                    content and padding of an element. Borders define the outer edge or
                    boundary of the element. Borders can have a specific width, style,
                    and color, which can be set using the border property in CSS. Border
                    properties can also be specified for each side of the element
                    independently (border-top, border-right, border-bottom,
                    border-left). Borders can be solid, dashed, dotted, double, etc.,
                    depending on the border-style property.

                <p>
                    1. Solid: The solid border style creates a solid line around the
                    element. <br />
                    <strong>Example:</strong>
                    border-style: solid;
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong> 2. Dashed:</strong>

                    The dashed border style creates a series of short dashes around the
                    element. <br />
                    &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Example:</strong> border-style:
                    dashed;
                </p>
                <p>
                    3. Dashed:

                    The dashed border style creates a series of short dashes around the element.
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Example: </strong>border-style: dashed;

            <h4>Discuss the difference between margin: auto and text-align: center for
                centering elements horizontally.
            </h4>
            <p>
                Both margin: auto and text-align: center can be used to center elements horizontally, but they operate
                differently and are applied in different contexts. Let's discuss the difference between them:

            </p>
            <p>
                1. margin: auto:

                When you apply margin: auto to an element, it sets the left and right margins of the element to auto.
                This causes the element to be horizontally centered within its containing block.
                margin: auto is typically used for block-level elements, such as
            <div> or <p>, that have a defined width. It centers the entire element, including its content and any other
                    elements inside it.
                    This technique is commonly used for centering block-level elements with a fixed width.
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Example</strong>.centered-element {
                    width: 200px;
                    margin: auto;
                    }

                </p>
                <p>
                    2. text-align: center:

                    When you apply text-align: center to a parent element, it horizontally aligns the text content of
                    its child elements. This property does not affect the layout or positioning of block-level elements
                    themselves, only their text content.
                    text-align: center is typically applied to the parent container of inline or inline-block elements,
                    such as a
                    div or (span), to center-align the text content within those elements.
                    This technique is commonly used for centering text within inline or inline-block elements.
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Example:</strong> .parent-container {
                    text-align: center;
                    }

                    .centered-text {
                    display: inline-block;
                    }

                </p>

                <article>
                    <p>

                        The overflow property in CSS controls how content that is too big to fit inside an element is
                        handled. It specifies whether to clip the content, display scrollbars, or automatically expand
                        the container to accommodate the overflowing content. The overflow property can take one of the
                        following values:
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        1. visible: This is the default value. Content that overflows the element's box is displayed
                        outside the box, overlapping other content if necessary.

                        2. hidden: Content that overflows the element's box is clipped and not displayed.


                    </p>
                    <p>
                        3. scroll: Scrollbars are added to the element's box, allowing the user to scroll to view the
                        overflowing content.
